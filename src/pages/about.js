    <Layout pageTitle="About Me">
      <p>My name is Genesis Ellis, and I’ve been preparing taxes since 2018. I’ve helped hundreds of people maximize their refunds and are helping small business owners to reduce or eliminate their tax liabilities. I’ve also served as a volunteer at my old high school to educate young workers on how to file taxes.

I’ve learned through years of professional and entrepreneurial experience what it means to deliver fantastic customer service and make annual income within 4 months. I look forward to helping you meet your goals, reduce your tax liability, increase your tax refund, propel your business, and/or embark on the path to a profitable new tax preparation business.
